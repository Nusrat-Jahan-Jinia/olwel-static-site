         <p>This app is owned by Olwel Oy Ltd. Below are the statements that clearly depict what android permissions this app uses to run itself and what purpose those permissions serve.</p>
         <h4>Internet Permission:</h4>
         <p><i>(android.permission.INTERNET)</i></p>
         <p>Purpose: This app uses the Internet to communicate with the Olwel server to retrieve visit information and history. It also uploads information of the visit to the Olwel server.</p>
         <h4>Access to Network State Permission:</h4>
         <p><i>(android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE)</i></p>
         <p>Purpose: This app needs to determine the network state show a helpful message to the user when no network connection is available.</p>
         <h4>Access to WiFi State Permission:</h4>
         <p><i>(android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE)</i></p>
         <p>Purpose: This app needs access to the WiFi state to show a helpful message to the user so he/she can decide whether or not to use the Internet.</p>
         <h4>Access to Fine Location Permission:</h4>
         <p><i>(android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)</i></p>
         <p>Purpose: This app needs to know the users location in order to determine if the user is geographically close to the patient’s location. Only doctors (who are users of this app) who are close to the patient’s location receive a home visit request from.</p>
         <h4>Access to Coarse Location Permission:</h4>
         <p><i>(android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)</i></p>
         <p>Purpose: This app needs access to coarse location to know if the user (doctor) is geographically close to the patient. The app also needs access to users location when it is running in the background, so it can determine whether to dispatch a home visit request to the user. And during a patient visit, the app sends the users location to the Olwel server, so the Olwel dispatch centre is aware of the doctors location and can assist the patient with the ETA of the doctor, or send help to the doctor if he is in any trouble. This permission is also needed to show information on Google Maps to the user.</p>
         <h4>Camera Permission:</h4>
         <p><i>(android.permission.CAMERA)</i></p>
         <p>Purpose: This app uses the camera to take picture of the prescription given to the patient. The prescription image is then uploaded to the Olwel server for future reference.</p>
         <h4>Read from Google Services Permission:</h4>
         <p><i>(com.google.android.providers.gsf.permission.READ_GSERVICES)</i></p>
         <p>Purpose: This app needs this permission to access the Google Maps API. The map is displayed to the user so he/she can reach the patient’s location easily.</p>
         <h4>Read External Storage Permission:</h4>
         <p><i>(android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)</i></p>
         <p>Purpose: If the user fails to take a prescription image from the app for any reason, he/she can use the phone’s Photo App to take the prescription image. Then he/she can use the app to upload that image to the Olwel server. This is why the app needs to read images from the photo gallery and hence it requires this permission.</p>
         <h4>Write External Storage Permission:</h4>
         <p><i>(android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)</i></p>
         <p>Purpose: The app needs saves the prescription image in the photo gallery, so the user can still have access to the prescription image in case the app crashes or fails to upload the prescription image itself. This is why the app needs to write to the photo gallery, and hence requires this permission.</p>
